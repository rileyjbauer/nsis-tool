**IGNITE Nutrition-Sensitive Intervention Selection Tool**
The Nutrition-Sensitive Intervention Selection (NSIS) Tool is an interactive webapp that provides potential nutrition interventions tailored to where one is working in the food system.

**IGNITE Overview**
The Impacting Gender & Nutrition through Innovative Technical Exchange in Agriculture (IGNITE) mechanism is a five-year investment funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and implemented by Tanager, Laterite, and 60 Decibels to strengthen African institutions’ ability to integrate nutrition and gender into their way of doing business and their agriculture interventions.

IGNITE also identifies models that demonstrate ways of effectively and efficiently increasing both equitable consumption of safe, affordable, nutritious diets year-round and increased women’s empowerment in agriculture, and cultivates networks of local service providers to reach greater nutrition impact and gender equality in agriculture through ongoing technical assistance.
